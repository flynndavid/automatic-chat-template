### Technical Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) App Router with React Server Components
- [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) for LLM integration and chat interfaces
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for authentication and data persistence

- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) for type-safe database operations

## Model Providers

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Development Setup

HomeFax.ai is built for insurance agencies to provide AI-powered policy interpretation to their clients.

## Running Locally

You will need to set up environment variables for Supabase, AI providers, and other services.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Set up your environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run database migrations: `pnpm db:migrate`
5. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`

Your HomeFax.ai application should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
