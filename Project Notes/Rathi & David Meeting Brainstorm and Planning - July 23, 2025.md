# Rathi & David - HomeFax Insurance App Discussion

### Project Overview

- New AI-based insurance interpretation tool called HomeFax
    - For homeowner/vehicle insurance policies
    - Tool helps interpret policies and answer customer questions
    - Positioning as agent-focused solution that saves time
    - Initially working with Valor, an insurance agency based in Easton
        - Meeting rescheduled to August
        - CEO bringing two senior management members

### Product Concept

- AI tool that reads insurance policies and answers policyholder questions
    - Reduces agency workload during high-volume periods (storms, emergencies)
    - Creates persistent record of all communications
    - Includes fail-safe where agent can review AI responses
    - Long-term vision: “CARFAX for homes” - building property data history
- System design
    - Agent can embed chatbot on website or provide app to clients
    - Agent reviews AI-generated answers before sending to clients
    - Communication registry for tracking all interactions
    - Focus on interface that’s accessible 24/7

### Key Value Propositions

- For insurance agents:
    - Reduces repetitive customer service inquiries
    - Allows focus on selling policies rather than answering basic questions
    - Creates communication record to prevent disputes
    - Makes agency appear tech-forward to clients
- For homeowners:
    - 24/7 access to policy information
    - Faster answers to common questions
    - Better documentation of claims and communications
- For adjusters:
    - Potential to streamline documentation with photos/videos
    - More efficient claims processing

### Implementation Approach

- Target insurance agencies rather than direct-to-consumer
    - Agencies promote tool to their policyholders
    - B2B sales much more cost-effective than B2C marketing
- Policy integration options:
    - CC HomeFax on policy emails to auto-create profiles
    - Agent uploads policies (potential challenge with large client bases)
    - Future: API integration with agency systems
- Need to research laws, regulations and compliance requirements
- Pricing model options:
    - Charge agencies around $10/year per policy or bulk pricing
    - Position as time-saving tool worth the investment

### Technical Considerations

- Build as API-first solution for flexibility
    - Can deploy as website widget, standalone app, or embedded in existing systems
- PDF-centric initially, but remain format-agnostic
    - Support for extracting data from photos, databases, file systems
- Integration challenges with legacy systems
    - Insurance companies often have outdated tech stacks
    - Need to determine where/how policies are stored at Valor
- Potential to leverage AI to automate data extraction
    - Reference site shared: [https://certificial.com/](https://certificial.com/)

### Future Expansion Ideas

- Vehicle insurance integration
    - Possible driving habit tracking via phone sensors
    - Optional sharing with insurance companies for rate discounts
- Contractor integration
    - Allow verified contractors to submit home improvement data
    - Create more reliable property history

### Next Steps

- Meeting with Valor in August
    - Present general concept and workflow
    - Get feedback on implementation preferences
    - Explore potential partnership/investment opportunity
- Key questions for Valor:
    - Where should the tool live? (website, app, etc.)
    - What’s their current tech stack?
    - How do they currently store policy information?
