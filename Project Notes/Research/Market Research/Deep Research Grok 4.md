### 1. Problem & Market Need

**What pain point are you solving?**

HomeFax addresses several interconnected pain points in the home insurance ecosystem. For homeowners, key issues include confusion over policy details, inadequate documentation for claims, and a lack of centralized tracking for home maintenance and improvements, which often leads to denied claims or underpayments. Insurance agents face challenges like time-consuming manual policy explanations, fragmented communication logs, and limited tools for verifying home history, resulting in inefficiencies during underwriting, claims processing, and compliance. Overall, the lack of a verifiable, persistent home data repository creates opacity, increases dispute risks, and hinders risk assessment accuracy.

**How are people currently solving this problem?**

Current solutions are fragmented and often manual or semi-digital. Homeowners typically rely on spreadsheets, email threads, or apps like HomeZada for basic maintenance tracking and inventory management, which offers schedules, budgeting, and photo uploads but lacks AI interpretation or agent integration. For policy management, tools like policy binders or carrier portals (e.g., from Allstate or Liberty Mutual) provide access to documents, but they don't centralize maintenance history or offer AI-driven Q&A. Agents use agency management systems (AMS) like Applied Epic or Vertafore for policy handling and claims, but these focus on internal workflows rather than homeowner-facing transparency. Some use email forwards or CSV uploads for ingestion, but without immutable logs. Emerging insurtech like [Sprout.ai](http://sprout.ai/) automates claims document handling, yet it doesn't build a "home history" like Carfax. BuildFax provides permit history reports, but it's limited to public records, not user-submitted improvements. Overall, solutions are siloed, leading to reliance on physical receipts, phone calls, or ad-hoc tools, which are error-prone and time-intensive.

**Is the problem urgent, recurring, or expensive?**

The problem is urgent, recurring, and expensive. Extreme weather events and rising premiums (average 21% increase in 2025) strain claims satisfaction, with long repair cycles and poor documentation leading to disputes—J.D. Power's 2025 study notes widespread dissatisfaction due to these issues.
<argument name="citation_id">82</argument>
Recurring pain points include annual policy renewals, ongoing maintenance (e.g., preventing claims from neglected issues like plumbing), and frequent interactions (homeowners contact agents multiple times yearly for clarifications). Costs are high: denied claims average $10,000-$20,000 losses per homeowner, while agents lose hours weekly on manual tasks, inflating operational costs. Industry-wide, poor claims management contributes to $173B+ market inefficiencies, with fraud and errors costing billions annually.
<argument name="citation_id">35</argument>
Macro trends like climate risks amplify urgency, as AI-driven prevention could reduce catastrophe losses.
<argument name="citation_id">98</argument>

### 2. Target Audience

**Who exactly are your users/customers?**

Primary users are independent insurance agents and agencies (B2B focus in Phase 1), who integrate HomeFax into their workflows for policy management and client service. Secondary users include homeowners (via agency widgets/apps) for self-service Q&A and history tracking, and in Phase 2, contractors for verified submissions, real estate agents for reports, and insurers/carriers for API access.

**What are their demographics, behaviors, and motivations?**

<argument name="citation_id">39</argument>
- Lemonade: Strengths—Fast AI claims; Weaknesses—Consumer-only, no agency tools.

**How will you differentiate?**

HomeFax differentiates via AI policy interpreter + immutable logs, agent-human review hybrid, and "HomeFax Report" as a verifiable asset (like Carfax). Unlike siloed tools, it bridges homeowners/agents/contractors with API for insurers.

### 5. Business Model

**How will you make money? (Subscription, transaction, ads, etc.)**

Primary: SaaS subscription ($10/year/policy for agencies, tiered bulk). Secondary: Transaction fees ($25/report for real estate), potential contractor upsells, B2B API access.

**What’s your pricing strategy?**

Value-based: $10/policy aligns with per-policy costs; free trial for 100 policies encourages adoption. Competitive—insurtech SaaS averages $500-1K/month/agency, but HomeFax's low per-policy scales better.

**Are there alternative revenue streams?**

Yes: Premium homeowner app subscriptions, data marketplace (anonymized insights for carriers), ads from verified contractors, or white-label for carriers.

### 6. Customer Acquisition

**How will you reach your first 100 customers?**

Pilot with Valor Insurance, then expand to 10 agencies via referrals/demos. Use LinkedIn outreach, industry webinars, and partnerships (e.g., Big "I").

**What channels are most effective (SEO, ads, social, partnerships)?**

Partnerships (carriers/agencies) and content marketing (SEO on insurtech blogs) top for insurtech SaaS; social (LinkedIn/X) for agents.
<argument name="citation_id">67</argument>
Paid ads (Google/LinkedIn) for targeted reach.

**CAC vs. LTV projections?**

Insurtech SaaS CAC averages $519-1,280 (B2B).
<argument name="citation_id">69</argument>
HomeFax CAC: ~$300-500 (partnership-focused). LTV: $500-1K/customer (5-10 years retention at $10/policy, assuming 50-100 policies/agency). Ideal LTV:CAC 3:1+.
<argument name="citation_id">70</argument>

### 7. Regulatory & Legal

**Any licenses, insurance, or compliance needs?**

Needs SOC 2 certification (planned), compliance with GLBA for PII, state privacy laws (e.g., CCPA). No direct insurance license if not underwriting, but partner with licensed entities.

**What are the legal risks or limitations?**

AI inaccuracy (hallucinations) risks liability—mitigate via agent review. Data privacy breaches under GDPR/HIPAA analogs; regulatory scrutiny on AI bias.
<argument name="citation_id">50</argument>
Limitations: State-varying rules on policy data handling.

### 8. Feasibility & Tech Stack

**Can you build an MVP with available tools/resources?**

Yes: Proposed stack (React/Supabase/OpenAI/Claude) is feasible for MVP. Open-source tools + APIs enable quick build; $500K seed covers development.
