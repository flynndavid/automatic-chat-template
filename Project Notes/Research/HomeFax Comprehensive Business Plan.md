## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity**
HomeFax addresses a critical gap in the $144-173 billion US home insurance market, where 57% of homeowners don't understand their policy coverage and 40% of claims face denial due to poor documentation. The convergence of AI technology maturity, insurance industry digital transformation pressure, and consumer demand for transparency creates a compelling market opportunity valued at $430-740 million annually.

**The Solution**
HomeFax is an AI-powered platform that interprets insurance policies in plain language, maintains persistent home maintenance records, and provides 24/7 homeowner support through insurance agents. By combining policy AI with verifiable home history tracking, HomeFax creates the "Carfax for homes" — a comprehensive, trusted record that benefits homeowners, agents, and insurers.

**Market Validation**
Our comprehensive market research validates significant pain points: claims documentation failures contribute to the longest claim cycles since 2008 (32.4 days average), while independent agents face a looming workforce crisis with 50% retiring within 15 years. The insurtech sector's explosive growth (25.3% CAGR) and proven willingness to pay for efficiency tools confirm market readiness.

**Business Model**
HomeFax operates a dual-revenue model targeting insurance agencies at $10 per policy annually, supplemented by transaction-based HomeFax Reports at $25 each for real estate transactions. This approach leverages established Carfax pricing benchmarks while addressing verified market demand for property history transparency.

**Competitive Advantage**
No direct competitor offers our comprehensive solution combining AI policy interpretation, agent integration, and persistent home history. Our agent-integrated approach with human review queues differentiates from pure AI solutions, while our neutral platform works across all carriers and agents — unlike walled-garden insurtech carriers.

**Financial Projections**
With conservative penetration of 1% of independent agencies (300-400 agencies managing ~300,000 policies), HomeFax projects $3-5 million ARR within 3-5 years. Strong unit economics with LTV:CAC ratios of 3.6-4.2x and 12-24 month payback periods support sustainable growth toward our serviceable obtainable market of $430-740 million annually.

**Funding Requirements**
HomeFax seeks $500,000 in seed funding to support 12-month runway covering MVP development, pilot program execution, regulatory compliance implementation, and team expansion. This positions the company for Series A funding aligned with current insurtech medians of $3.8 million.
