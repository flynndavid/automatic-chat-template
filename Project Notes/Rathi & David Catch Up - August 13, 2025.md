Wed, 13 Aug 25 · Rathi Niyogi

### Valor Partnership & Market Opportunity

- Valor has own dealer network: associated agencies setting up mini brokerages nationwide
  - Built-in user base for proof of concept launch and revenue generation
  - Only works with associated agencies, creating controlled distribution channel
- Meeting tomorrow at noon at Valor offices in Easton (pending confirmation)
- Industry connections through organization with 25,000 independent agencies membership
  - Potential affiliate relationship: 5% revenue share for member referrals over 2 years
  - Word-of-mouth sales approach vs direct marketing to hundreds of millions of policyholders
- Lawyer on staff (family member) for insurance compliance guidance
  - Insurance heavily regulated industry requiring legal oversight
- Market size: 39,000 independent property & casualty agencies in US
  - Target agencies with digitized policies (40+ year agencies may have non-digital files)

### AI Agent Product Definition & Features

- AI agent for independent insurance brokers combining hometown service with cutting-edge technology
- Customer segmentation and capabilities:
  - Non-customers: appointment booking via Calendly integration, sales Q&A, policy recommendations, lead qualification
  - Existing policyholders: 24/7 policy Q&A for home and auto insurance, claims guidance
- Three-party conversation model: policyholder + insurance agent + AI agent
  - AI handles immediate responses with asterisk disclaimers
  - Agent reviews and confirms all AI recommendations
  - Example: 3am deer collision - bot provides coverage assessment but requires agent confirmation
- Email monitoring and context embedding:
  - All customer interactions logged for training and context
  - AI can respond to emails based on knowledge base
  - Paper trail maintenance for compliance requirements
- Custom knowledge base building:
  - Agency-specific FAQs and procedures (claim filing process, preferred first steps)
  - Multiple insurance carrier information (20+ auto carriers per agency typical)
  - Document ingestion via Google Drive-style interface with 24-hour AI analysis
  - Agency review and approval process for generated content

### Technical Architecture & Data Requirements

- Policy document access absolutely critical - potential deal breaker if not digitized
  - Legacy agencies (40+ years) may have non-digital customer files
  - Requires behavioral changes from agencies for full digitization
- Integration possibilities:
  - Current systems: potential Salesforce-like insurance platforms
  - Cloud storage: SharePoint, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box
  - Long-term goal: API-level integration with insurance carriers (3-5 years)
- Security and compliance solutions:
  - OpenAI's local GPT-4os model runs locally without external data transmission
  - Facebook's open-source models as alternatives
  - AWS/cloud platform deployment for security and scalability
- Deployment method: Website chatbot widget as primary entry point
  - Plug-and-play integration for agency websites
  - Eventually SDK release for larger carriers like State Farm

### Business Model & Revenue Strategy

- Two-tier pricing structure:
  - Setup fee for initial onboarding, customization, and training
  - Monthly recurring revenue model (suggested $10 per user starting point)
- Cost structure analysis:
  - Major costs: setup/onboarding labor, ongoing AI usage fees
  - Hosting costs relatively minimal (hundreds per month maximum)
  - Variable AI costs manageable due to infrequent insurance interactions
- Long-term monetization vision (3-5 years):
  - $7 annual technology fee per policy built into insurance premiums
  - Market potential: 75M homeowner + 200M+ auto policies
  - Fee invisible to customers in context of $1,500+ annual premiums
  - Requires carrier cooperation and API-level integration
- Pricing philosophy: affordability key for market penetration
  - Avoid targeting only $10M+ agencies
  - Focus on broad accessibility across 39,000 independent agencies
  - Built-in policy fees eliminate direct agency cost burden

### Implementation Strategy & Funding Path

- MVP approach prioritizing simplicity over custom development
  - Use existing automation tools (Zapier-style workflows) initially
  - Build 2-3 manual but replicable solutions before scaling
  - Avoid overbuilding like previous Vibrant Cyber experience
- Valor as pilot customer and equity partner
  - Real-world testing environment with industry expertise
  - Built-in feedback loop for product iteration
  - Risk mitigation through contained internal deployment
- Standalone entity structure: David, Rathi, Valor as three equity holders
  - Allows future fundraising rounds and complex corporate structure
  - Maintains optionality for scaling decisions
- Projected fundraising timeline:
  - Initial phase: labor investment vs capital investment
  - $100K annual revenue milestone → $1M investment at $10M valuation
  - $2M revenue milestone → $10M raise at $75M valuation
  - Valor connections provide access to pre-seed angel investors
- Marketing cost considerations:
  - Email marketing infrastructure development
  - Webinar series for industry education
  - Trade organization partnerships vs direct sales approach
  - Software margins support higher marketing spend tolerance

### Next Steps & Key Questions for Valor Meeting

- Technical feasibility assessment:
  - Current tech stack and policy storage systems
  - API capabilities of existing platforms
  - Policy volume per agency (estimated thousands for 20-year agencies)
- Compliance and regulatory requirements deep dive
- Pricing model validation with industry knowledge
- Integration complexity evaluation for pilot deployment
